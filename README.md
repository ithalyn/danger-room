GSE - Custom effort to be reviewed is within the classes:
Katas.NumberNames.Test.TranslatorTests
Katas.NumberNames.Translator

Additional Informaiton:
Unit testing in this example has been performed utilizing the NUnit framework. I have used many, but I have to admit that it is one of my favorites, for its ease of use. Additionally, after long thought and given the time limit, I decided that it would be optimal to show how I would complete a common programming exercise in my own style, rather than trying to come up with an impressive project idea. I hope you understand. 

A few thoughts to go along with this code, (though I am open to the ideas of others and willing to try pretty much anything) it is my opinion that comments should be as infrequent as possible, assuming SOLID principles and strong naming are addiquitely applied. Therefore, you will not see many (or any) comments in this code. The tests are illustrated to describe themselves based on the defined "expected" and "actual" values, in order to reduce wasted time and effort creating fixtures. Lastly, this exercise did not afford me the opportunity to illustrate an extensive view of my technical knowledge. That said, my hope is that a demonstration of logical analysis and unit testing fundimentals will allow for the opportunity to discuss and/or demonstrate more specific skills (such as API design, concurrency, etc.).

Thank you for taking the time to check out my work, and I hope to speak to you soon.
